# SSAI-101 — 46-Day Course Plan (Day by Day)

**Softpro School of AI — AI Development Summer Training**
3 hours/day · 46 days · 4 phases · **3 mini-projects + 1 capstone**, all deployed to public URLs.

> Days **1–7** are a Python power-up (prerequisite skills locked in before any LLM work). The AI
> track begins Day 8. Every phase ends with a shipped, deployed project.

## Daily 3-hour session structure
Each day is a single 3-hour block:

| Block | Time | Activity |
|-------|:----:|----------|
| Concept + live coding | 75 min | Trainer-led walkthrough of the day's modules; questions welcome |
| Guided build (code-along) | 45 min | Students type along, TA floats for help |
| Independent work | 45 min | Exercises / mini-project work / doubt-solving |
| Standup + wrap-up | 15 min | Recap, blockers, preview of next day |

Each day in this repo maps to a `Day-XX-Topic/` folder with numbered modules (`01-…`, `02-…`),
runnable examples, and an `exercises/` set.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundations (Days 1–15)
*Goal: everyone at baseline; first working, deployed LLM app.*

### Python week (Days 1–7)
| Day | Topic | Key modules |
|----:|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Python setup, data types, operators & variables | running-python, numbers, operators, comments, variables, naming, assignment-ops, print |
| 2 | Strings, f-strings & string methods | strings, indexing, slices, escape/triple-quote, len/input/type-casting, f-strings, methods |
| 3 | Booleans, conditionals & logical operators | booleans, comparison, truthiness, if/elif/else, random, nesting, and/or/not, precedence |
| 4 | Loops | while, for, range, break/continue, nested loops |
| 5 | Functions & scope | params, return, default/keyword args, scope (LEGB), global, `*args`/`**kwargs` |
| 6 | Data structures | lists, dicts, tuples, sets (methods, slicing, iteration, mutability) |
| 7 | Errors, modules & OOP | error types, try/except, modules & pip, classes, methods, inheritance, `super()` |

### LLM foundations (Days 8–15)
| Day | Topic |
|----:|-------|
| 8 | Python for AI: `requests`, async basics, `dotenv`, **Pydantic**, type hints |
| 9 | LLM fundamentals: tokens, context windows, sampling (temperature, top-p), model families — **first Groq API call** |
| 10 | Prompt engineering I: system prompts, zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought |
| 11 | Prompt engineering II: structured outputs with Pydantic, JSON mode |
| 12 | Multi-provider patterns: one abstraction over Groq, Ollama, Gemini |
| 13 | Working with data: JSON, CSV, PDF (PyPDF2/pdfplumber), lightweight scraping (BeautifulSoup) |
| 14 | Streamlit crash course + error handling, retries, rate limits, cost awareness |
| 15 | **Mini-project 1 build + deploy + demo** |

**🚀 Project 1 — AI Content Summarizer.** Input: PDF / article URL / transcript. Output:
structured summary (key points, TL;DR, action items). Stack: Streamlit + Groq + Python.
Deployed free on Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Community Cloud.

---

## Phase 2 — RAG & Memory (Days 16–20)
*Goal: apps that use external knowledge — the single most employable AI skill right now.*

| Day | Topic |
|----:|-------|
| 16 | **CLI chatbot: conversation memory** — keep a `messages` list and append every turn (Groq, free) |
| 17 | Embeddings fundamentals: what they are; free options (sentence-transformers, Gemini embeddings) |
| 18 | Chroma — first vector DB: save vectors, retrieve them, chat with AI |
| 19 | Streamlit from scratch — turn our scripts into a web app (widgets, session state, caching, chat) |
| 20 | **Mini-Project 1: Chat With Your Documents** — Streamlit + file upload (PDF/DOCX/TXT) + Chroma RAG + Groq; also teaches file handling & Python modules |

**🚀 Project 1 — Chat With Your Documents (Day 20).** Upload notes / textbooks / papers → ask
questions → cited answers, grounded in your files. Stack: Streamlit + Chroma + `sentence-transformers`
+ Groq.

> **Plan change (2026-07):** the original RAG deep-dive days (chunking / hybrid retrieval / re-ranking
> / LlamaIndex / Mini-project 2) are **deferred**. We pivot straight into the **agent frameworks**
> track — LangChain → LangGraph → agents — which now begins at **Day 21** as Phase 3. The dropped RAG
> topics may return later as optional deep-dives.

---

## Phase 3 — Agents & Tools (Days 21–32)
*Goal: go from Q&A bots to agents that take actions — the differentiator. We start with the
framework everything else builds on (LangChain), then LangGraph, then real agents.*

| Day | Topic |
|----:|-------|
| 21 | **LangChain fundamentals** — chat models, prompt templates, LCEL (`prompt \| model \| parser`), output parsers, runnables, memory (LangChain 1.x) ✅ |
| 22 | **LangChain in practice** — RAG **with LangChain** (splitters, `Chroma` + local embeddings, retrievers, an LCEL RAG chain) + a **Streamlit × LangChain** chatbot & "chat with your docs" app ✅ |
| 23 | **LangChain tools + Chat With Your Database** — tools / function calling (`@tool`, `bind_tools`), the hand-written tool-calling loop, and a **text-to-SQL agent** over a SQLite store (CLI + Streamlit) ✅ |
| 24 | **LangGraph** — state machines for AI: state/nodes/edges, branching (conditional edges), loops (cycles), reducers (`add_messages`), memory (checkpointer + `thread_id`) ✅ |
| 25 | Building a ReAct agent (`create_agent`) — combines Day 23's tools + Day 24's graph engine |
| 26 | CrewAI — role-based multi-agent, made simple |
| 27 | AutoGen (Microsoft) — conversation-based multi-agent |
| 28 | Framework comparison workshop — same agent in 3 frameworks, pick which fits |
| 29 | Observability: Langfuse — tracing an agent, debugging failures |
| 30 | Guardrails & safety: prompt-injection defense, output validation |
| 31 | **Mini-project 3 build day** |
| 32 | **Mini-project 3 deploy + demo** |

**🚀 Project 3 — Personal Research Agent.** Researches a topic across the web, takes notes,
produces a briefing. Student picks the framework (LangGraph / CrewAI / AutoGen). Must use 3+
tools. Traced in Langfuse. Deployed free.

> **Numbering note (2026-07):** Phase 3 was pulled forward to Day 21 (see the Phase 2 plan-change
> note). A **LangChain-in-practice day (RAG + Streamlit) was then inserted at Day 22**, pushing
> LangGraph → 23 and every later Phase-3 day +1. **Then tools were pulled *before* LangGraph:** a
> **Tools + "Chat With Your Database" day was inserted at Day 23**, moving LangGraph → 24. (Tools had
> been the planned Day 24, so this is effectively a swap plus a project — Phase 3 stays **21–32**.)
> Phase 4's day numbers below still reflect the old schedule and will be reconciled in a later pass;
> treat Phase 4 as "after Phase 3", not as fixed dates.

## Phase 4 — Capstone + Placement (Days 39–46)
*Goal: ship one portfolio-grade project + get placement-ready.*

| Day | Activity |
|----:|----------|
| 39 | Capstone ideation workshop + scoping |
| 40 | 1:1 architecture review with trainer + project setup |
| 41 | Build sprint — day 1 (daily standups, trainer check-ins) |
| 42 | Build sprint — day 2 |
| 43 | Build sprint — day 3 + deployment (CI/CD basics, env vars, monitoring) |
| 44 | Demo day + peer code review |
| 45 | Resume + LinkedIn + GitHub polish + mock interviews |
| 46 | Portfolio site launch (Vercel) + certificate ceremony |

**🏁 Capstone (student picks one, must be deployed + demoable):**
1. Multi-agent research assistant — topic in, briefing out, with citations
2. WhatsApp AI business assistant — Twilio + Groq + Supabase
3. AI customer support for a local business — RAG on their FAQ/catalog
4. Code review agent — runs on a GitHub repo, posts PR comments
5. Educational tutor for one subject — adaptive study buddy
6. AI finance tracker — ingests statements, natural-language insights
7. AI recipe generator — dietary-aware, grocery-list output
8. AI news briefing agent — daily personalized digest, scheduled

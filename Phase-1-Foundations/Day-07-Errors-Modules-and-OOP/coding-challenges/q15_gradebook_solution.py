Problem 15 - Class gradebook   (SOLUTION)

Run:
    python q15_gradebook_solution.py

Logic note:
  This is the capstone: a dict whose VALUES are lists (nested data). sum(marks)/
  len(marks) is the average per student. topper() reuses averages() instead of
  recomputing -- build small functions and stack them. "best so far" finds the max.
